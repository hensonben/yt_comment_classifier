## Youtube Comment Sentiment Classifier

This project fine-tunes a DistilBERT transformer model to classify YouTube comments into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments. The goal was to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and learn in detail the process of fine-tuning pretrained language models using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch. Additionally, the dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of user comments retrieved from YouTube videos, each labeled with a sentiment category; positive, neutral, and negative respectively.

### Tools and Libraries used;
- Python 3.13
- Hugging Face Transformers (v4.57.1)
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch 2.8.0
- Accelerate 1.10.1
### Dataset;
**File:** `YoutubeCommentsDataSet.csv`
**columns;**
- `comment` the text of the YouTube comment
- `sentiment` label (*positive*, *neutral*, *negative*)

After preprocessing;
- The `text` transformed into tokenized input to the model.
- The `label` was encoded with integer values, 0 = negative, 1 = neutral, 2 = positive.

### Results
| Metric | Score |
|---------|:------:|
| **Training Loss** | 0.37 |
| **Evaluation Loss** | 0.49 |
| **Accuracy** | 0.84 |
| **Weighted F1 Score** | 0.84 |

Overall the model achieved strong performance on unseen YouTube comments, which demonstrated effective transfer learning from pretrained weights to real-world text.
